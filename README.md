- Some of the things I enjoy and use(d) ⬆️.
- Trying to write software that [prevents the collapse of civilization](https://youtu.be/ZSRHeXYDLko).  Fast computers lead to lazy programmers.
- Electrical & Electronic Engineer by education, Software Engineer by heart.
- Recently completed my Master's in radar engineering and machine learning.
- Currently working as a Software and ML/MLOps engineer.
- 💍 (*Was*) Most likely the only [married](https://github.com/Wifeagen) Arch Linux user.  Now a NixOS enjoyer.

- **The Linux Kernel:**  The work done here is obviously exceptional - I would love to contribute one day.
- **Game Engines:**  I have written a graphics engine from scratch and the technology is fascinating (and complex!).  Hopefully I can work on something like this again.
- **Radars:**  Obviously, I did my Master's thesis in this topic!
