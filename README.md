- Electrical & Electronic Engineer by education, Software Engineer by heart.
- Currently busy with my Master's in radar engineering and machine learning.
- I really like [Neovim](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim).

- **The Linux Kernel:**  The work done here is obviously exceptional - I would love to contribute one day.
- **Game Engines:**  I have written a graphics engine from scratch and the technology is fascinating (and complex!).  Hopefully I can work on something like this again.  *The engine repo is currently private due to legal reasons, I hope to make it public soon.*
- **Radars:**  Obviously, I did my Master's thesis in this topic!  *The repo is currently private, will make it public after my thesis has been published.*
